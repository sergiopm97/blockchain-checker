# Blockchain Checker

Download and export data and statistics for all Blockchain tokens ðŸª™ðŸ“‰

## Features

- Extract data from the bids and asks of a particular symbol
- Generate statistics from the bids and asks of a particular symbol
- Generate summary statistics of all symbols
- Export all the data and statistics in JSON format

## App setup

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sergiopm97/blockchain-checker
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd blockchain-checker
```

Create virtual environment

```bash
  python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
  & env/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

Install the requirements in the virtual environment

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API usage

With the virtual environment activated, run the followind command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This command is going to start the server with the API in the http://127.0.0.1:8000 url. The developed endpoints are the following ones:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/all -> returns the generic statistics for all the symbols in the Blockchain API
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/symbols/{symbol} -> return the statistics and the data for an specific symbol

## Terminal interface for local data extraction

With the virtual environment activated, all you have to do is to execute the main.py file:

```bash
python .\terminal_app.py
```
